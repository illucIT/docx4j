docx4j-JAXB-ReferenceImpl
=========================

Add this jar if you want docx4j to use the JAXB Reference Implementation

This gets used because jaxb-runtime-4.0.5.jar!/META-INF/services/jakarta.xml.bind.JAXBContextFactory
contains org.glassfish.jaxb.runtime.v2.JAXBContextFactory

See further https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jaxb-ri 

Could consider renaming to "Eclipse Implementation".
